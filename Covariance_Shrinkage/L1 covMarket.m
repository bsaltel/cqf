function [sigma,shrinkage]=covMarket(x,shrink)

% function sigma=covmarket(x)
% x (t*n): t iid observations on n random variables
% sigma (n*n): invertible covariance matrix estimator
%
% This estimator is a weighted average of the sample
% covariance matrix and a "prior" or "shrinkage target".
% Here, the prior is given by a one-factor model.
% The factor is equal to the cross-sectional average
% of all the random variables.

% The notation follows Ledoit and Wolf (2003)
